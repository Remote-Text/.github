# Welcome to RemoteText

RemoteText is an open source file editing tool. The goal of remote text is to provide a simple platform for storing, editing, and viewing text files (LaTeX, Markdown, and others) that provides support for version control.

We have [a backend server written in Rust](https://github.com/Remote-Text/remote-text-server) that stores the files, along with [a web client written in Javascript](https://github.com/Remote-Text/remote-text-client) and [an iPhone client written in Swift](https://github.com/Remote-Text/remote-text-ios-client).

Feel free to check out our code! If you would like to report a bug, feel free to open an issue. If you would like to fix an open issue, feel free to make a pull request!
