# Welcome to RemoteText

RemoteText is an open source file editing tool. The goal of remote text is to provide a simple platform for storing, editing, and viewing text files (latex, markdown, and others) that provides support for version control

We have a backend server written in Rust that stores the files, along with a web client written in Javascript and a iPhone client written in Swift.
